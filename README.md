# Chess
Just a simple program I'm workin on to learn and have fun.
I'm just making up everything as I go at the moment, but at some point I may reference the [Chess Programming Wiki](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page).

## TODO
- [ ] Proper chess board in UI
- [ ] Move validation
- [ ] Actually moving the pieces
- [ ] Winning, Losing, Ties
- [ ] FEN String input for board setup
- [ ] Export moves list
- [ ] [clap](https://clap.rs) for arguments -  FEN setup, options, AI settings, etc.
- [ ] Computer opponent
